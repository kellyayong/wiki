## Welcome to Oh My Zsh!

Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.

- You'll need `zsh` to install **Oh My Zsh**. Run `zsh --version` to check if you have it:

  ```console
  $ zsh --version
  zsh 5.8 (x86_64-ubuntu-linux-gnu)
  ```

- If you see `command not found` you don't have zsh installed. See [[Installing Zsh]] for instructions.
- Once you have zsh, you can install Oh My Zsh by simply running one of these commands:

  | Method    | Command                                                                                           |
  | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | **curl**  | `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"` |
  | **wget**  | `sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`   |
  | **fetch** | `sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"` |

  **NOTE: the installer will rename an existing `.zshrc` file to `.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh`.**

- Alternatively, the installer is also mirrored outside GitHub. **Using this URL may be required if you're in a country like India or China, that blocks `raw.githubusercontent.com`**:

  | Method    | Command                                          |
  | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
  | **curl**  | `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://install.ohmyz.sh)"` |
  | **wget**  | `sh -c "$(wget -O- https://install.ohmyz.sh)"`   |
  | **fetch** | `sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://install.ohmyz.sh)"` |
